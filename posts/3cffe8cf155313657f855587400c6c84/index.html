<p>    The FHS mailing list<br>     Background of the FHS<br>     General Guidelines<br>     Scope<br>     Acknowledgments<br>     Contributors</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Chapter 1. Introduction</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This standard enables:</p> 
<p>  * Software to predict the location of installed files and directories, and</p> 
<p>  * Users to predict the location of installed files and directories.</p> 
<p>We do this by:</p> 
<p>  * Specifying guiding principles for each area of the filesystem,</p> 
<p>  * Specifying the minimum files and directories required,</p> 
<p>  * Enumerating exceptions to the principles, and</p> 
<p>  * Enumerating specific cases where there has been historical conflict.</p> 
<p>The FHS document is used by:</p> 
<p>  * Independent software suppliers to create applications which are FHS<br>     compliant, and work with distributions which are FHS complaint,</p> 
<p>  * OS creators to provide systems which are FHS compliant, and</p> 
<p>  * Users to understand and maintain the FHS compliance of a system.</p> 
<p>The FHS document has a limited scope:</p> 
<p>  * Local placement of local files is a local issue, so FHS does not attempt to<br>     usurp system administrators.</p> 
<p>  * FHS addresses issues where file placements need to be coordinated between<br>     multiple parties such as local sites, distributions, applications,<br>     documentation, etc.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Conventions</p> 
<p>We recommend that you read a typeset version of this document rather than the<br> plain text version. In the typeset version, the names of files and directories<br> are displayed in a constant-width font.</p> 
<p>Components of filenames that vary are represented by a description of the<br> contents enclosed in "&lt;" and "&gt;" characters, &lt;thus&gt;. Electronic mail addresses<br> are also enclosed in "&lt;" and "&gt;" but are shown in the usual typeface.</p> 
<p>Optional components of filenames are enclosed in "[" and "]" characters and may<br> be combined with the "&lt;" and "&gt;" convention. For example, if a filename is<br> allowed to occur either with or without an extension, it might be represented<br> by &lt;filename&gt;[.&lt;extension&gt;].</p> 
<p>Variable substrings of directory names and filenames are indicated by "*".</p> 
<p>The sections of the text marked as Rationale are explanatory and are<br> non-normative.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Chapter 2. The Filesystem</p> 
<p>This standard assumes that the operating system underlying an FHS-compliant<br> file system supports the same basic security features found in most UNIX<br> filesystems.</p> 
<p>It is possible to define two independent distinctions among files: shareable<br> vs. unshareable and variable vs. static. In general, files that differ in<br> either of these respects should be located in different directories. This makes<br> it easy to store files with different usage characteristics on different<br> filesystems.</p> 
<p>"Shareable" files are those that can be stored on one host and used on others.<br> "Unshareable" files are those that are not shareable. For example, the files in<br> user home directories are shareable whereas device lock files are not.</p> 
<p>"Static" files include binaries, libraries, documentation files and other files<br> that do not change without system administrator intervention. "Variable" files<br> are files that are not static.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: Shareable files can be stored on one host and used on several<br>     others. Typically, however, not all files in the filesystem hierarchy are<br>     shareable and so each system has local storage containing at least its<br>     unshareable files. It is convenient if all the files a system requires that<br>     are stored on a foreign host can be made available by mounting one or a few<br>     directories from the foreign host.</p> 
<p>    Static and variable files should be segregated because static files, unlike<br>     variable files, can be stored on read-only media and do not need to be<br>     backed up on the same schedule as variable files.</p> 
<p>    Historical UNIX-like filesystem hierarchies contained both static and<br>     variable files under both /usr and /etc. In order to realize the advantages<br>     mentioned above, the /var hierarchy was created and all variable files were<br>     transferred from /usr to /var. Consequently /usr can now be mounted<br>     read-only (if it is a separate filesystem). Variable files have been<br>     transferred from /etc to /var over a longer period as technology has<br>     permitted.</p> 
<p>    Here is an example of a FHS-compliant system. (Other FHS-compliant layouts<br>     are possible.)</p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Chapter 3. The Root Filesystem</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The contents of the root filesystem must be adequate to boot, restore, recover,<br> and/or repair the system.</p> 
<p>  * To boot a system, enough must be present on the root partition to mount<br>     other filesystems. This includes utilities, configuration, boot loader<br>     information, and other essential start-up data. /usr, /opt, and /var are<br>     designed such that they may be located on other partitions or filesystems.</p> 
<p>  * To enable recovery and/or repair of a system, those utilities needed by an<br>     experienced maintainer to diagnose and reconstruct a damaged system must be<br>     present on the root filesystem.</p> 
<p>  * To restore a system, those utilities needed to restore from system backups<br>     (on floppy, tape, etc.) must be present on the root filesystem.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: The primary concern used to balance these considerations, which<br>     favor placing many things on the root filesystem, is the goal of keeping<br>     root as small as reasonably possible. For several reasons, it is desirable<br>     to keep the root filesystem small:</p> 
<p>      + It is occasionally mounted from very small media.</p> 
<p>      + The root filesystem contains many system-specific configuration files.<br>         Possible examples include a kernel that is specific to the system, a<br>         specific hostname, etc. This means that the root filesystem isn't<br>         always shareable between networked systems. Keeping it small on servers<br>         in networked systems minimizes the amount of lost space for areas of<br>         unshareable files. It also allows workstations with smaller local hard<br>         drives.</p> 
<p>      + While you may have the root filesystem on a large partition, and may be<br>         able to fill it to your heart's content, there will be people with<br>         smaller partitions. If you have more files installed, you may find<br>         incompatibilities with other systems using root filesystems on smaller<br>         partitions. If you are a developer then you may be turning your<br>         assumption into a problem for a large number of users.</p> 
<p>      + Disk errors that corrupt data on the root filesystem are a greater<br>         problem than errors on any other partition. A small root filesystem is<br>         less prone to corruption as the result of a system crash.</p> 
<p>Applications must never create or require special files or subdirectories in<br> the root directory. Other locations in the FHS hierarchy provide more than<br> enough flexibility for any package.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: There are several reasons why creating a new subdirectory of the<br>     root filesystem is prohibited:</p> 
<p>      + It demands space on a root partition which the system administrator may<br>         want kept small and simple for either performance or security reasons.</p> 
<p>      + It evades whatever discipline the system administrator may have set up<br>         for distributing standard file hierarchies across mountable volumes.</p> 
<p>    Distributions should not create new directories in the root hierarchy<br>     without extremely careful consideration of the consequences including for<br>     application portability.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, are required in /.</p> 
<p>Directory                    Description<br> bin       Essential command binaries<br> boot      Static files of the boot loader<br> dev       Device files<br> etc       Host-specific system configuration<br> lib       Essential shared libraries and kernel modules<br> media     Mount point for removeable media<br> mnt       Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily<br> opt       Add-on application software packages<br> sbin      Essential system binaries<br> srv       Data for services provided by this system<br> tmp       Temporary files<br> usr       Secondary hierarchy<br> var       Variable data</p> 
<p>Each directory listed above is specified in detail in separate subsections<br> below. /usr and /var each have a complete section in this document due to the<br> complexity of those directories.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /, if<br> the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory                      Description<br> home      User home directories (optional)<br> lib&lt;qual&gt; Alternate format essential shared libraries (optional)<br> root      Home directory for the root user (optional)</p> 
<p>Each directory listed above is specified in detail in separate subsections<br> below.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/bin : Essential user command binaries (for use by all users)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/bin contains commands that may be used by both the system administrator and by<br> users, but which are required when no other filesystems are mounted (e.g. in<br> single user mode). It may also contain commands which are used indirectly by<br> scripts. [1]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>There must be no subdirectories in /bin.</p> 
<p>The following commands, or symbolic links to commands, are required in /bin.</p> 
<p>Command                       Description<br> cat      Utility to concatenate files to standard output<br> chgrp    Utility to change file group ownership<br> chmod    Utility to change file access permissions<br> chown    Utility to change file owner and group<br> cp       Utility to copy files and directories<br> date     Utility to print or set the system data and time<br> dd       Utility to convert and copy a file<br> df       Utility to report filesystem disk space usage<br> dmesg    Utility to print or control the kernel message buffer<br> echo     Utility to display a line of text<br> false    Utility to do nothing, unsuccessfully<br> hostname Utility to show or set the system's host name<br> kill     Utility to send signals to processes<br> ln       Utility to make links between files<br> login    Utility to begin a session on the system<br> ls       Utility to list directory contents<br> mkdir    Utility to make directories<br> mknod    Utility to make block or character special files<br> more     Utility to page through text<br> mount    Utility to mount a filesystem<br> mv       Utility to move/rename files<br> ps       Utility to report process status<br> pwd      Utility to print name of current working directory<br> rm       Utility to remove files or directories<br> rmdir    Utility to remove empty directories<br> sed      The `sed' stream editor<br> sh       The Bourne command shell<br> stty     Utility to change and print terminal line settings<br> su       Utility to change user ID<br> sync     Utility to flush filesystem buffers<br> true     Utility to do nothing, successfully<br> umount   Utility to unmount file systems<br> uname    Utility to print system information</p> 
<p>If /bin/sh is not a true Bourne shell, it must be a hard or symbolic link to<br> the real shell command.</p> 
<p>The [ and test commands must be placed together in either /bin or /usr/bin.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: For example bash behaves differently when called as sh or bash.<br>     The use of a symbolic link also allows users to easily see that /bin/sh is<br>     not a true Bourne shell.</p> 
<p>    The requirement for the [ and test commands to be included as binaries<br>     (even if implemented internally by the shell) is shared with the POSIX.2<br>     standard.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following programs, or symbolic links to programs, must be in /bin if the<br> corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Command                Description<br> csh     The C shell (optional)<br> ed      The `ed' editor (optional)<br> tar     The tar archiving utility (optional)<br> cpio    The cpio archiving utility (optional)<br> gzip    The GNU compression utility (optional)<br> gunzip  The GNU uncompression utility (optional)<br> zcat    The GNU uncompression utility (optional)<br> netstat The network statistics utility (optional)<br> ping    The ICMP network test utility (optional)</p> 
<p>If the gunzip and zcat programs exist, they must be symbolic or hard links to<br> gzip. /bin/csh may be a symbolic link to /bin/tcsh or /usr/bin/tcsh.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: The tar, gzip and cpio commands have been added to make<br>     restoration of a system possible (provided that / is intact).</p> 
<p>    Conversely, if no restoration from the root partition is ever expected,<br>     then these binaries might be omitted (e.g., a ROM chip root, mounting /usr<br>     through NFS). If restoration of a system is planned through the network,<br>     then ftp or tftp (along with everything necessary to get an ftp connection)<br>     must be available on the root partition.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/boot : Static files of the boot loader</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory contains everything required for the boot process except<br> configuration files not needed at boot time and the map installer. Thus /boot<br> stores data that is used before the kernel begins executing user-mode programs.<br> This may include saved master boot sectors and sector map files. [2]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The operating system kernel must be located in either / or /boot. [3]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/dev : Device files</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The /dev directory is the location of special or device files.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>If it is possible that devices in /dev will need to be manually created, /dev<br> must contain a command named MAKEDEV, which can create devices as needed. It<br> may also contain a MAKEDEV.local for any local devices.</p> 
<p>If required, MAKEDEV must have provisions for creating any device that may be<br> found on the system, not just those that a particular implementation installs.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/etc : Host-specific system configuration</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The /etc hierarchy contains configuration files. A "configuration file" is a<br> local file used to control the operation of a program; it must be static and<br> cannot be an executable binary. [4]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>No binaries may be located under /etc. [5]</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories are required in /<br> etc:</p> 
<p>Directory                   Description<br> opt       Configuration for /opt<br> X11       Configuration for the X Window system (optional)<br> sgml      Configuration for SGML (optional)<br> xml       Configuration for XML (optional)</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories must be in /etc, if<br> the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory      Description<br> opt       Configuration for /opt</p> 
<p>The following files, or symbolic links to files, must be in /etc if the<br> corresponding subsystem is installed: [6]</p> 
<p>   File                                 Description<br> csh.login   Systemwide initialization file for C shell logins (optional)<br> exports     NFS filesystem access control list (optional)<br> fstab       Static information about filesystems (optional)<br> ftpusers    FTP daemon user access control list (optional)<br> gateways    File which lists gateways for routed (optional)<br> gettydefs   Speed and terminal settings used by getty (optional)<br> group       User group file (optional)<br> host.conf   Resolver configuration file (optional)<br> hosts       Static information about host names (optional)<br> hosts.allow Host access file for TCP wrappers (optional)<br> hosts.deny  Host access file for TCP wrappers (optional)<br> hosts.equiv List of trusted hosts for rlogin, rsh, rcp (optional)<br> hosts.lpd   List of trusted hosts for lpd (optional)<br> inetd.conf  Configuration file for inetd (optional)<br> inittab     Configuration file for init (optional)<br> issue       Pre-login message and identification file (optional)<br> ld.so.conf  List of extra directories to search for shared libraries (optional)<br> motd        Post-login message of the day file (optional)<br> mtab        Dynamic information about filesystems (optional)<br> mtools.conf Configuration file for mtools (optional)<br> networks    Static information about network names (optional)<br> passwd      The password file (optional)<br> printcap    The lpd printer capability database (optional)<br> profile     Systemwide initialization file for sh shell logins (optional)<br> protocols   IP protocol listing (optional)<br> resolv.conf Resolver configuration file (optional)<br> rpc         RPC protocol listing (optional)<br> securetty   TTY access control for root login (optional)<br> services    Port names for network services (optional)<br> shells      Pathnames of valid login shells (optional)<br> syslog.conf Configuration file for syslogd (optional)</p> 
<p>mtab does not fit the static nature of /etc: it is excepted for historical<br> reasons. [7]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/etc/opt : Configuration files for /opt</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>Host-specific configuration files for add-on application software packages must<br> be installed within the directory /etc/opt/&lt;subdir&gt;, where &lt;subdir&gt; is the name<br> of the subtree in /opt where the static data from that package is stored.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>No structure is imposed on the internal arrangement of /etc/opt/&lt;subdir&gt;.</p> 
<p>If a configuration file must reside in a different location in order for the<br> package or system to function properly, it may be placed in a location other<br> than /etc/opt/&lt;subdir&gt;.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: Refer to the rationale for /opt.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/etc/X11 : Configuration for the X Window System (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/etc/X11 is the location for all X11 host-specific configuration. This<br> directory is necessary to allow local control if /usr is mounted read only.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following files, or symbolic links to files, must be in /etc/X11 if the<br> corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>   File                              Description<br> Xconfig    The configuration file for early versions of XFree86 (optional)<br> XF86Config The configuration file for XFree86 versions 3 and 4 (optional)<br> Xmodmap    Global X11 keyboard modification file (optional)</p> 
<p>Subdirectories of /etc/X11 may include those for xdm and for any other programs<br> (some window managers, for example) that need them. [8] We recommend that<br> window managers with only one configuration file which is a default .*wmrc file<br> must name it system.*wmrc (unless there is a widely-accepted alternative name)<br> and not use a subdirectory. Any window manager subdirectories must be<br> identically named to the actual window manager binary.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/etc/sgml : Configuration files for SGML (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>Generic configuration files defining high-level parameters of the SGML systems<br> are installed here. Files with names *.conf indicate generic configuration<br> files. File with names *.cat are the DTD-specific centralized catalogs,<br> containing references to all other catalogs needed to use the given DTD. The<br> super catalog file catalog references all the centralized catalogs.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/etc/xml : Configuration files for XML (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>Generic configuration files defining high-level parameters of the XML systems<br> are installed here. Files with names *.conf indicate generic configuration<br> files. The super catalog file catalog references all the centralized catalogs.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/home : User home directories (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/home is a fairly standard concept, but it is clearly a site-specific<br> filesystem. [9] The setup will differ from host to host. Therefore, no program<br> should rely on this location. [10]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>User specific configuration files for applications are stored in the user's<br> home directory in a file that starts with the '.' character (a "dot file"). If<br> an application needs to create more than one dot file then they should be<br> placed in a subdirectory with a name starting with a '.' character, (a "dot<br> directory"). In this case the configuration files should not start with the '.'<br> character. [11]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/lib : Essential shared libraries and kernel modules</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The /lib directory contains those shared library images needed to boot the<br> system and run the commands in the root filesystem, ie. by binaries in /bin and<br> /sbin. [12]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>At least one of each of the following filename patterns are required (they may<br> be files, or symbolic links):</p> 
<p>  File                    Description<br> libc.so.* The dynamically-linked C library (optional)<br> ld*       The execution time linker/loader (optional)</p> 
<p>If a C preprocessor is installed, /lib/cpp must be a reference to it, for<br> historical reasons. [13]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /lib,<br> if the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory            Description<br> modules   Loadable kernel modules (optional)</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/lib&lt;qual&gt; : Alternate format essential shared libraries (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>There may be one or more variants of the /lib directory on systems which<br> support more than one binary format requiring separate libraries. [14]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>If one or more of these directories exist, the requirements for their contents<br> are the same as the normal /lib directory, except that /lib&lt;qual&gt;/cpp is not<br> required. [15]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/media : Mount point for removeable media</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory contains subdirectories which are used as mount points for<br> removeable media such as floppy disks, cdroms and zip disks.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: Historically there have been a number of other different places<br>     used to mount removeable media such as /cdrom, /mnt or /mnt/cdrom. Placing<br>     the mount points for all removeable media directly in the root directory<br>     would potentially result in a large number of extra directories in /.<br>     Although the use of subdirectories in /mnt as a mount point has recently<br>     been common, it conflicts with a much older tradition of using /mnt<br>     directly as a temporary mount point.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /media,<br> if the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory        Description<br> floppy     Floppy drive (optional)<br> cdrom      CD-ROM drive (optional)<br> cdrecorder CD writer (optional)<br> zip        Zip drive (optional)</p> 
<p>On systems where more than one device exists for mounting a certain type of<br> media, mount directories can be created by appending a digit to the name of<br> those available above starting with '0', but the unqualified name must also<br> exist. [16]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/mnt : Mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory is provided so that the system administrator may temporarily<br> mount a filesystem as needed. The content of this directory is a local issue<br> and should not affect the manner in which any program is run.</p> 
<p>This directory must not be used by installation programs: a suitable temporary<br> directory not in use by the system must be used instead.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/opt : Add-on application software packages</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/opt is reserved for the installation of add-on application software packages.</p> 
<p>A package to be installed in /opt must locate its static files in a separate /<br> opt/&lt;package&gt; or /opt/&lt;provider&gt; directory tree, where &lt;package&gt; is a name that<br> describes the software package and &lt;provider&gt; is the provider's LANANA<br> registered name.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>Directory            Description<br> &lt;package&gt;  Static package objects<br> &lt;provider&gt; LANANA registered provider name</p> 
<p>The directories /opt/bin, /opt/doc, /opt/include, /opt/info, /opt/lib, and /opt<br> /man are reserved for local system administrator use. Packages may provide<br> "front-end" files intended to be placed in (by linking or copying) these<br> reserved directories by the local system administrator, but must function<br> normally in the absence of these reserved directories.</p> 
<p>Programs to be invoked by users must be located in the directory /opt/&lt;package&gt;<br> /bin or under the /opt/&lt;provider&gt; hierarchy. If the package includes UNIX<br> manual pages, they must be located in /opt/&lt;package&gt;/share/man or under the /<br> opt/&lt;provider&gt; hierarchy, and the same substructure as /usr/share/man must be<br> used.</p> 
<p>Package files that are variable (change in normal operation) must be installed<br> in /var/opt. See the section on /var/opt for more information.</p> 
<p>Host-specific configuration files must be installed in /etc/opt. See the<br> section on /etc for more information.</p> 
<p>No other package files may exist outside the /opt, /var/opt, and /etc/opt<br> hierarchies except for those package files that must reside in specific<br> locations within the filesystem tree in order to function properly. For<br> example, device lock files must be placed in /var/lock and devices must be<br> located in /dev.</p> 
<p>Distributions may install software in /opt, but must not modify or delete<br> software installed by the local system administrator without the assent of the<br> local system administrator.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: The use of /opt for add-on software is a well-established<br>     practice in the UNIX community. The System V Application Binary Interface<br>     [AT&amp;T 1990], based on the System V Interface Definition (Third Edition),<br>     provides for an /opt structure very similar to the one defined here.</p> 
<p>    The Intel Binary Compatibility Standard v. 2 (iBCS2) also provides a<br>     similar structure for /opt.</p> 
<p>    Generally, all data required to support a package on a system must be<br>     present within /opt/&lt;package&gt;, including files intended to be copied into /<br>     etc/opt/&lt;package&gt; and /var/opt/&lt;package&gt; as well as reserved directories in<br>     /opt.</p> 
<p>    The minor restrictions on distributions using /opt are necessary because<br>     conflicts are possible between distribution-installed and locally-installed<br>     software, especially in the case of fixed pathnames found in some binary<br>     software.</p> 
<p>    The structure of the directories below /opt/&lt;provider&gt; is left up to the<br>     packager of the software, though it is recommended that packages are<br>     installed in /opt/&lt;provider&gt;/&lt;package&gt; and follow a similar structure to<br>     the guidelines for /opt/package. A valid reason for diverging from this<br>     structure is for support packages which may have files installed in /opt/<br>     &lt;provider&gt;/lib or /opt/&lt;provider&gt;/bin.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/root : Home directory for the root user (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The root account's home directory may be determined by developer or local<br> preference, but this is the recommended default location. [17]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/sbin : System binaries</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>Utilities used for system administration (and other root-only commands) are<br> stored in /sbin, /usr/sbin, and /usr/local/sbin. /sbin contains binaries<br> essential for booting, restoring, recovering, and/or repairing the system in<br> addition to the binaries in /bin. [18] Programs executed after /usr is known to<br> be mounted (when there are no problems) are generally placed into /usr/sbin.<br> Locally-installed system administration programs should be placed into /usr/<br> local/sbin. [19]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>The following commands, or symbolic links to commands, are required in /sbin.</p> 
<p>Command             Description<br> shutdown Command to bring the system down.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following files, or symbolic links to files, must be in /sbin if the<br> corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Command                               Description<br> fastboot Reboot the system without checking the disks (optional)<br> fasthalt Stop the system without checking the disks (optional)<br> fdisk    Partition table manipulator (optional)<br> fsck     File system check and repair utility (optional)<br> fsck.*   File system check and repair utility for a specific filesystem<br>          (optional)<br> getty    The getty program (optional)<br> halt     Command to stop the system (optional)<br> ifconfig Configure a network interface (optional)<br> init     Initial process (optional)<br> mkfs     Command to build a filesystem (optional)<br> mkfs.*   Command to build a specific filesystem (optional)<br> mkswap   Command to set up a swap area (optional)<br> reboot   Command to reboot the system (optional)<br> route    IP routing table utility (optional)<br> swapon   Enable paging and swapping (optional)<br> swapoff  Disable paging and swapping (optional)<br> update   Daemon to periodically flush filesystem buffers (optional)</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/srv : Data for services provided by this system</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/srv contains site-specific data which is served by this system.</p> 
<p><br>     Rationale: This main purpose of specifying this is so that users may find<br>     the location of the data files for particular service, and so that services<br>     which require a single tree for readonly data, writable data and scripts<br>     (such as cgi scripts) can be reasonably placed. Data that is only of<br>     interest to a specific user should go in that users' home directory.</p> 
<p>    The methodology used to name subdirectories of /srv is unspecified as there<br>     is currently no consensus on how this should be done. One method for<br>     structuring data under /srv is by protocol, eg. ftp, rsync, www, and cvs.<br>     On large systems it can be useful to structure /srv by administrative<br>     context, such as /srv/physics/www, /srv/compsci/cvs, etc. This setup will<br>     differ from host to host. Therefore, no program should rely on a specific<br>     subdirectory structure of /srv existing or data necessarily being stored in<br>     /srv. However /srv should always exist on FHS compliant systems and should<br>     be used as the default location for such data.</p> 
<p>    Distributions must take care not to remove locally placed files in these<br>     directories without administrator permission. [20]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/tmp : Temporary files</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The /tmp directory must be made available for programs that require temporary<br> files.</p> 
<p>Programs must not assume that any files or directories in /tmp are preserved<br> between invocations of the program.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: IEEE standard P1003.2 (POSIX, part 2) makes requirements that<br>     are similar to the above section.</p> 
<p>    Although data stored in /tmp may be deleted in a site-specific manner, it<br>     is recommended that files and directories located in /tmp be deleted<br>     whenever the system is booted.</p> 
<p>    FHS added this recommendation on the basis of historical precedent and<br>     common practice, but did not make it a requirement because system<br>     administration is not within the scope of this standard.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Chapter 4. The /usr Hierarchy</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/usr is the second major section of the filesystem. /usr is shareable,<br> read-only data. That means that /usr should be shareable between various<br> FHS-compliant hosts and must not be written to. Any information that is<br> host-specific or varies with time is stored elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Large software packages must not use a direct subdirectory under the /usr<br> hierarchy.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, are required in /<br> usr.</p> 
<p>Directory                   Description<br> bin       Most user commands<br> include   Header files included by C programs<br> lib       Libraries<br> local     Local hierarchy (empty after main installation)<br> sbin      Non-vital system binaries<br> share     Architecture-independent data</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>Directory                   Description<br> X11R6     XWindow System, version 11 release 6 (optional)<br> games     Games and educational binaries (optional)<br> lib&lt;qual&gt; Alternate Format Libraries (optional)<br> src       Source code (optional)</p> 
<p>An exception is made for the X Window System because of considerable precedent<br> and widely-accepted practice.</p> 
<p>The following symbolic links to directories may be present. This possibility is<br> based on the need to preserve compatibility with older systems until all<br> implementations can be assumed to use the /var hierarchy.</p> 
<p>    /usr/spool -&gt; /var/spool<br>     /usr/tmp -&gt; /var/tmp<br>     /usr/spool/locks -&gt; /var/lock</p> 
<p>Once a system no longer requires any one of the above symbolic links, the link<br> may be removed, if desired.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/X11R6 : X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This hierarchy is reserved for the X Window System, version 11 release 6, and<br> related files.</p> 
<p>To simplify matters and make XFree86 more compatible with the X Window System<br> on other systems, the following symbolic links must be present if /usr/X11R6<br> exists:</p> 
<p>    /usr/bin/X11 -&gt; /usr/X11R6/bin<br>     /usr/lib/X11 -&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/X11<br>     /usr/include/X11 -&gt; /usr/X11R6/include/X11</p> 
<p>In general, software must not be installed or managed via the above symbolic<br> links. They are intended for utilization by users only. The difficulty is<br> related to the release version of the X Window System - in transitional<br> periods, it is impossible to know what release of X11 is in use.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>Host-specific data in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 should be interpreted as a<br> demonstration file. Applications requiring information about the current host<br> must reference a configuration file in /etc/X11, which may be linked to a file<br> in /usr/X11R6/lib. [21]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/bin : Most user commands</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This is the primary directory of executable commands on the system.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /usr/<br> bin, if the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory                     Description<br> mh        Commands for the MH mail handling system (optional)</p> 
<p>/usr/bin/X11 must be a symlink to /usr/X11R6/bin if the latter exists.</p> 
<p>The following files, or symbolic links to files, must be in /usr/bin, if the<br> corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Command                       Description<br> perl    The Practical Extraction and Report Language (optional)<br> python  The Python interpreted language (optional)<br> tclsh   Simple shell containing Tcl interpreter (optional)<br> wish    Simple Tcl/Tk windowing shell (optional)<br> expect  Program for interactive dialog (optional)</p> 
<p>    Rationale: Because shell script interpreters (invoked with #!&lt;path&gt; on the<br>     first line of a shell script) cannot rely on a path, it is advantageous to<br>     standardize their locations. The Bourne shell and C-shell interpreters are<br>     already fixed in /bin, but Perl, Python, and Tcl are often found in many<br>     different places. They may be symlinks to the physical location of the<br>     shell interpreters.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/include : Directory for standard include files.</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This is where all of the system's general-use include files for the C<br> programming language should be placed.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /usr/<br> include, if the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory                Description<br> bsd       BSD compatibility include files (optional)</p> 
<p>The symbolic link /usr/include/X11 must link to /usr/X11R6/include/X11 if the<br> latter exists.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/lib : Libraries for programming and packages</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/usr/lib includes object files, libraries, and internal binaries that are not<br> intended to be executed directly by users or shell scripts. [22]</p> 
<p>Applications may use a single subdirectory under /usr/lib. If an application<br> uses a subdirectory, all architecture-dependent data exclusively used by the<br> application must be placed within that subdirectory. [23]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>For historical reasons, /usr/lib/sendmail must be a symbolic link to /usr/sbin/<br> sendmail if the latter exists. [24]</p> 
<p>If /lib/X11 exists, /usr/lib/X11 must be a symbolic link to /lib/X11, or to<br> whatever /lib/X11 is a symbolic link to. [25]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/lib&lt;qual&gt; : Alternate format libraries (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/usr/lib&lt;qual&gt; performs the same role as /usr/lib for an alternate binary<br> format, except that the symbolic links /usr/lib&lt;qual&gt;/sendmail and /usr/lib<br> &lt;qual&gt;/X11 are not required. [26]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/local : Local hierarchy</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when installing<br> software locally. It needs to be safe from being overwritten when the system<br> software is updated. It may be used for programs and data that are shareable<br> amongst a group of hosts, but not found in /usr.</p> 
<p>Locally installed software must be placed within /usr/local rather than /usr<br> unless it is being installed to replace or upgrade software in /usr. [27]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /usr/<br> local</p> 
<p>Directory                      Description<br> bin       Local binaries<br> etc       Host-specific system configuration for local binaries<br> games     Local game binaries<br> include   Local C header files<br> lib       Local libraries<br> man       Local online manuals<br> sbin      Local system binaries<br> share     Local architecture-independent hierarchy<br> src       Local source code</p> 
<p>No other directories, except those listed below, may be in /usr/local after<br> first installing a FHS-compliant system.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>If directories /lib&lt;qual&gt; or /usr/lib&lt;qual&gt; exist, the equivalent directories<br> must also exist in /usr/local.</p> 
<p>/usr/local/etc may be a symbolic link to /etc/local.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: The consistency of /usr/local/etc is beneficial to installers,<br>     and is already used in other systems. As all of /usr/local needs to be<br>     backed up to reproduce a system, it introduces no additional maintenance<br>     overhead, but a symlink to /etc/local is suitable if systems want alltheir<br>     configuration under one hierarchy.</p> 
<p>    Note that /usr/etc is still not allowed: programs in /usr should place<br>     configuration files in /etc.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/local/share</p> 
<p>The requirements for the contents of this directory are the same as /usr/share.<br> The only additional constraint is that /usr/local/share/man and /usr/local/man<br> directories must be synonomous (usually this means that one of them must be a<br> symbolic link). [28]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/sbin : Non-essential standard system binaries</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory contains any non-essential binaries used exclusively by the<br> system administrator. System administration programs that are required for<br> system repair, system recovery, mounting /usr, or other essential functions<br> must be placed in /sbin instead. [29]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/share : Architecture-independent data</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The /usr/share hierarchy is for all read-only architecture independent data<br> files. [30]</p> 
<p>This hierarchy is intended to be shareable among all architecture platforms of<br> a given OS; thus, for example, a site with i386, Alpha, and PPC platforms might<br> maintain a single /usr/share directory that is centrally-mounted. Note,<br> however, that /usr/share is generally not intended to be shared by different<br> OSes or by different releases of the same OS.</p> 
<p>Any program or package which contains or requires data that doesn't need to be<br> modified should store that data in /usr/share (or /usr/local/share, if<br> installed locally). It is recommended that a subdirectory be used in /usr/share<br> for this purpose.</p> 
<p>Game data stored in /usr/share/games must be purely static data. Any modifiable<br> files, such as score files, game play logs, and so forth, should be placed in /<br> var/games.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /usr/<br> share</p> 
<p>Directory                 Description<br> man       Online manuals<br> misc      Miscellaneous architecture-independent data</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /usr/<br> share, if the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory                       Description<br> dict      Word lists (optional)<br> doc       Miscellaneous documentation (optional)<br> games     Static data files for /usr/games (optional)<br> info      GNU Info system s primary directory (optional)<br> locale    Locale information (optional)<br> nls       Message catalogs for Native language support (optional)<br> sgml      SGML data (optional)<br> terminfo  Directories for terminfo database (optional)<br> tmac      troff macros not distributed with groff (optional)<br> xml       XML data (optional)<br> zoneinfo  Timezone information and configuration (optional)</p> 
<p>It is recommended that application-specific, architecture-independent<br> directories be placed here. Such directories include groff, perl, ghostscript,<br> texmf, and kbd (Linux) or syscons (BSD). They may, however, be placed in /usr/<br> lib for backwards compatibility, at the distributor's discretion. Similarly, a<br> /usr/lib/games hierarchy may be used in addition to the /usr/share/games<br> hierarchy if the distributor wishes to place some game data there.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/share/dict : Word lists (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory is the home for word lists on the system; Traditionally this<br> directory contains only the English words file, which is used by look(1) and<br> various spelling programs. words may use either American or British spelling.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: The reason that only word lists are located here is that they<br>     are the only files common to all spell checkers.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following files, or symbolic links to files, must be in /usr/share/dict, if<br> the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>File            Description<br> words List of English words (optional)</p> 
<p>Sites that require both American and British spelling may link words to ?usr/<br> share/dict/american-english or ?usr/share/dict/british-english.</p> 
<p>Word lists for other languages may be added using the English name for that<br> language, e.g., /usr/share/dict/french, /usr/share/dict/danish, etc. These<br> should, if possible, use an ISO 8859 character set which is appropriate for the<br> language in question; if possible the Latin1 (ISO 8859-1) character set should<br> be used (this is often not possible).</p> 
<p>Other word lists must be included here, if present.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/share/man : Manual pages</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This section details the organization for manual pages throughout the system,<br> including /usr/share/man. Also refer to the section on /var/cache/man.</p> 
<p>The primary &lt;mandir&gt; of the system is /usr/share/man. /usr/share/man contains<br> manual information for commands and data under the / and /usr filesystems. [31]</p> 
<p>Manual pages are stored in &lt;mandir&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;/man&lt;section&gt;/&lt;arch&gt;. An<br> explanation of &lt;mandir&gt;, &lt;locale&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;arch&gt; is given below.</p> 
<p>A description of each section follows:</p> 
<p>  * man1: User programs Manual pages that describe publicly accessible commands<br>     are contained in this chapter. Most program documentation that a user will<br>     need to use is located here.</p> 
<p>  * man2: System calls This section describes all of the system calls (requests<br>     for the kernel to perform operations).</p> 
<p>  * man3: Library functions and subroutines Section 3 describes program library<br>     routines that are not direct calls to kernel services. This and chapter 2<br>     are only really of interest to programmers.</p> 
<p>  * man4: Special files Section 4 describes the special files, related driver<br>     functions, and networking support available in the system. Typically, this<br>     includes the device files found in /dev and the kernel interface to<br>     networking protocol support.</p> 
<p>  * man5: File formats The formats for many data files are documented in the<br>     section 5. This includes various include files, program output files, and<br>     system files.</p> 
<p>  * man6: Games This chapter documents games, demos, and generally trivial<br>     programs. Different people have various notions about how essential this<br>     is.</p> 
<p>  * man7: Miscellaneous Manual pages that are difficult to classify are<br>     designated as being section 7. The troff and other text processing macro<br>     packages are found here.</p> 
<p>  * man8: System administration Programs used by system administrators for<br>     system operation and maintenance are documented here. Some of these<br>     programs are also occasionally useful for normal users.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /usr/<br> share/&lt;mandir&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;, unless they are empty: [32]</p> 
<p>Directory           Description<br> man1      User programs (optional)<br> man2      System calls (optional)<br> man3      Library calls (optional)<br> man4      Special files (optional)<br> man5      File formats (optional)<br> man6      Games (optional)<br> man7      Miscellaneous (optional)<br> man8      System administration (optional)</p> 
<p>The component &lt;section&gt; describes the manual section.</p> 
<p>Provisions must be made in the structure of /usr/share/man to support manual<br> pages which are written in different (or multiple) languages. These provisions<br> must take into account the storage and reference of these manual pages.<br> Relevant factors include language (including geographical-based differences),<br> and character code set.</p> 
<p>This naming of language subdirectories of /usr/share/man is based on Appendix E<br> of the POSIX 1003.1 standard which describes the locale identification string -<br> the most well-accepted method to describe a cultural environment. The &lt;locale&gt;<br> string is:</p> 
<p>&lt;language&gt;[_&lt;territory&gt;][.&lt;character-set&gt;][,&lt;version&gt;]</p> 
<p>The &lt;language&gt; field must be taken from ISO 639 (a code for the representation<br> of names of languages). It must be two characters wide and specified with<br> lowercase letters only.</p> 
<p>The &lt;territory&gt; field must be the two-letter code of ISO 3166 (a specification<br> of representations of countries), if possible. (Most people are familiar with<br> the two-letter codes used for the country codes in email addresses.) It must be<br> two characters wide and specified with uppercase letters only. [33]</p> 
<p>The &lt;character-set&gt; field must represent the standard describing the character<br> set. If the ?character-set&gt; field is just a numeric specification, the number<br> represents the number of the international standard describing the character<br> set. It is recommended that this be a numeric representation if possible (ISO<br> standards, especially), not include additional punctuation symbols, and that<br> any letters be in lowercase.</p> 
<p>A parameter specifying a &lt;version&gt; of the profile may be placed after the ?&lt;character-set&gt; field, delimited by a comma. This may be used to discriminate<br> between different cultural needs; for instance, dictionary order versus a more<br> systems-oriented collating order. This standard recommends not using the<br> &lt;version&gt; field, unless it is necessary.</p> 
<p>Systems which use a unique language and code set for all manual pages may omit<br> the &lt;locale&gt; substring and store all manual pages in &lt;mandir&gt;. For example,<br> systems which only have English manual pages coded with ASCII, may store manual<br> pages (the man&lt;section&gt; directories) directly in /usr/share/man. (That is the<br> traditional circumstance and arrangement, in fact.)</p> 
<p>Countries for which there is a well-accepted standard character code set may<br> omit the ?character-set&gt; field, but it is strongly recommended that it be<br> included, especially for countries with several competing standards.</p> 
<p>Various examples:</p> 
<p>Language Territory      Character Set   Directory<br> English  -              ASCII           /usr/share/man/en<br> English  United Kingdom ISO 8859-15     /usr/share/man/en_GB<br> English  United States  ASCII           /usr/share/man/en_US<br> French   Canada         ISO 8859-1      /usr/share/man/fr_CA<br> French   France         ISO 8859-1      /usr/share/man/fr_FR<br> German   Germany        ISO 646         /usr/share/man/de_DE.646<br> German   Germany        ISO 6937        /usr/share/man/de_DE.6937<br> German   Germany        ISO 8859-1      /usr/share/man/de_DE.88591<br> German   Switzerland    ISO 646         /usr/share/man/de_CH.646<br> Japanese Japan          JIS             /usr/share/man/ja_JP.jis<br> Japanese Japan          SJIS            /usr/share/man/ja_JP.sjis<br> Japanese Japan          UJIS (or EUC-J) /usr/share/man/ja_JP.ujis</p> 
<p>Similarly, provision must be made for manual pages which are<br> architecture-dependent, such as documentation on device-drivers or low-level<br> system administration commands. These must be placed under an &lt;arch&gt; directory<br> in the appropriate man&lt;section&gt; directory; for example, a man page for the i386<br> ctrlaltdel(8) command might be placed in /usr/share/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man8/i386/<br> ctrlaltdel.8.</p> 
<p>Manual pages for commands and data under /usr/local are stored in /usr/local/<br> man. Manual pages for X11R6 are stored in /usr/X11R6/man. It follows that all<br> manual page hierarchies in the system must have the same structure as /usr/<br> share/man.</p> 
<p>The cat page sections (cat&lt;section&gt;) containing formatted manual page entries<br> are also found within subdirectories of &lt;mandir&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;, but are not required<br> nor may they be distributed in lieu of nroff source manual pages.</p> 
<p>The numbered sections "1" through "8" are traditionally defined. In general,<br> the file name for manual pages located within a particular section end with .<br> &lt;section&gt;.</p> 
<p>In addition, some large sets of application-specific manual pages have an<br> additional suffix appended to the manual page filename. For example, the MH<br> mail handling system manual pages must have mh appended to all MH manuals. All<br> X Window System manual pages must have an x appended to the filename.</p> 
<p>The practice of placing various language manual pages in appropriate<br> subdirectories of /usr/share/man also applies to the other manual page<br> hierarchies, such as /usr/local/man and /usr/X11R6/man. (This portion of the<br> standard also applies later in the section on the optional /var/cache/man<br> structure.)</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/share/misc : Miscellaneous architecture-independent data</p> 
<p>This directory contains miscellaneous architecture-independent files which<br> don't require a separate subdirectory under /usr/share.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following files, or symbolic links to files, must be in /usr/share/misc, if<br> the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>   File                             Description<br> ascii      ASCII character set table (optional)<br> magic      Default list of magic numbers for the file command (optional)<br> termcap    Terminal capability database (optional)<br> termcap.db Terminal capability database (optional)</p> 
<p>Other (application-specific) files may appear here, but a distributor may place<br> them in /usr/lib at their discretion. [34]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/share/sgml : SGML data (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/usr/share/sgml contains architecture-independent files used by SGML<br> applications, such as ordinary catalogs (not the centralized ones, see /etc/<br> sgml), DTDs, entities, or style sheets.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /usr/<br> share/sgml, if the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory      Description<br> docbook   docbook DTD (optional)<br> tei       tei DTD (optional)<br> html      html DTD (optional)<br> mathml    mathml DTD (optional)</p> 
<p>Other files that are not specific to a given DTD may reside in their own<br> subdirectory.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/share/xml : XML data (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/usr/share/xml contains architecture-independent files used by XML<br> applications, such as ordinary catalogs (not the centralized ones, see /etc/<br> sgml), DTDs, entities, or style sheets.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /usr/<br> share/xml, if the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory        Description<br> docbook   docbook XML DTD (optional)<br> xhtml     XHTML DTD (optional)<br> mathml    MathML DTD (optional)</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/src : Source code (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>Source code may be place placed in this subdirectory, only for reference<br> purposes. [35]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Chapter 5. The /var Hierarchy</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/var contains variable data files. This includes spool directories and files,<br> administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files.</p> 
<p>Some portions of /var are not shareable between different systems. For<br> instance, /var/log, /var/lock, and /var/run. Other portions may be shared,<br> notably /var/mail, /var/cache/man, /var/cache/fonts, and /var/spool/news.</p> 
<p>/var is specified here in order to make it possible to mount /usr read-only.<br> Everything that once went into /usr that is written to during system operation<br> (as opposed to installation and software maintenance) must be in /var.</p> 
<p>If /var cannot be made a separate partition, it is often preferable to move /<br> var out of the root partition and into the /usr partition. (This is sometimes<br> done to reduce the size of the root partition or when space runs low in the<br> root partition.) However, /var must not be linked to /usr because this makes<br> separation of /usr and /var more difficult and is likely to create a naming<br> conflict. Instead, link /var to /usr/var.</p> 
<p>Applications must generally not add directories to the top level of /var. Such<br> directories should only be added if they have some system-wide implication, and<br> in consultation with the FHS mailing list.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, are required in /<br> var.</p> 
<p>Directory                   Description<br> cache     Application cache data<br> lib       Variable state information<br> local     Variable data for /usr/local<br> lock      Lock files<br> log       Log files and directories<br> opt       Variable data for /opt<br> run       Data relevant to running processes<br> spool     Application spool data<br> tmp       Temporary files preserved between system reboots</p> 
<p>Several directories are `reserved' in the sense that they must not be used<br> arbitrarily by some new application, since they would conflict with historical<br> and/or local practice. They are:</p> 
<p>    /var/backups<br>     /var/cron<br>     /var/msgs<br>     /var/preserve</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /var,<br> if the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory                         Description<br> account   Process accounting logs (optional)<br> crash     System crash dumps (optional)<br> games     Variable game data (optional)<br> mail      User mailbox files (optional)<br> yp        Network Information Service (NIS) database files (optional)</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/account : Process accounting logs (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory holds the current active process accounting log and the<br> composite process usage data (as used in some UNIX-like systems by lastcomm and<br> sa).</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/cache : Application cache data</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/var/cache is intended for cached data from applications. Such data is locally<br> generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or calculation. The application<br> must be able to regenerate or restore the data. Unlike /var/spool, the cached<br> files can be deleted without data loss. The data must remain valid between<br> invocations of the application and rebooting the system.</p> 
<p>Files located under /var/cache may be expired in an application specific<br> manner, by the system administrator, or both. The application must always be<br> able to recover from manual deletion of these files (generally because of a<br> disk space shortage). No other requirements are made on the data format of the<br> cache directories.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: The existence of a separate directory for cached data allows<br>     system administrators to set different disk and backup policies from other<br>     directories in /var.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>Directory                Description<br> fonts     Locally-generated fonts (optional)<br> man       Locally-formatted manual pages (optional)<br> www       WWW proxy or cache data (optional)<br> &lt;package&gt; Package specific cache data (optional)</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/cache/fonts : Locally-generated fonts (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The directory /var/cache/fonts should be used to store any dynamically-created<br> fonts. In particular, all of the fonts which are automatically generated by<br> mktexpk must be located in appropriately-named subdirectories of /var/cache/<br> fonts. [36]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>Other dynamically created fonts may also be placed in this tree, under<br> appropriately-named subdirectories of /var/cache/fonts.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/cache/man : Locally-formatted manual pages (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory provides a standard location for sites that provide a read-only<br> /usr partition, but wish to allow caching of locally-formatted man pages. Sites<br> that mount /usr as writable (e.g., single-user installations) may choose not to<br> use /var/cache/man and may write formatted man pages into the cat&lt;section&gt;<br> directories in /usr/share/man directly. We recommend that most sites use one of<br> the following options instead:</p> 
<p>  * Preformat all manual pages alongside the unformatted versions.</p> 
<p>  * Allow no caching of formatted man pages, and require formatting to be done<br>     each time a man page is brought up.</p> 
<p>  * Allow local caching of formatted man pages in /var/cache/man.</p> 
<p>The structure of /var/cache/man needs to reflect both the fact of multiple man<br> page hierarchies and the possibility of multiple language support.</p> 
<p>Given an unformatted manual page that normally appears in &lt;path&gt;/man/&lt;locale&gt;/<br> man&lt;section&gt;, the directory to place formatted man pages in is /var/cache/man/<br> &lt;catpath&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;/cat&lt;section&gt;, where &lt;catpath&gt; is derived from &lt;path&gt; by<br> removing any leading usr and/or trailing share pathname components. (Note that<br> the &lt;locale&gt; component may be missing.) [37]</p> 
<p>Man pages written to /var/cache/man may eventually be transferred to the<br> appropriate preformatted directories in the source man hierarchy or expired;<br> likewise formatted man pages in the source man hierarchy may be expired if they<br> are not accessed for a period of time.</p> 
<p>If preformatted manual pages come with a system on read-only media (a CD-ROM,<br> for instance), they must be installed in the source man hierarchy (e.g. /usr/<br> share/man/cat&lt;section&gt;). /var/cache/man is reserved as a writable cache for<br> formatted manual pages.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: Release 1.2 of the standard specified /var/catman for this<br>     hierarchy. The path has been moved under /var/cache to better reflect the<br>     dynamic nature of the formatted man pages. The directory name has been<br>     changed to man to allow for enhancing the hierarchy to include<br>     post-processed formats other than "cat", such as PostScript, HTML, or DVI.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/crash : System crash dumps (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory holds system crash dumps. As of the date of this release of the<br> standard, system crash dumps were not supported under Linux but may be<br> supported by other systems which may comply with the FHS.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/games : Variable game data (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>Any variable data relating to games in /usr should be placed here. /var/games<br> should hold the variable data previously found in /usr; static data, such as<br> help text, level descriptions, and so on, must remain elsewhere, such as /usr/<br> share/games.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: /var/games has been given a hierarchy of its own, rather than<br>     leaving it merged in with the old /var/lib as in release 1.2. The<br>     separation allows local control of backup strategies, permissions, and disk<br>     usage, as well as allowing inter-host sharing and reducing clutter in /var/<br>     lib. Additionally, /var/games is the path traditionally used by BSD.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/lib : Variable state information</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This hierarchy holds state information pertaining to an application or the<br> system. State information is data that programs modify while they run, and that<br> pertains to one specific host. Users must never need to modify files in /var/<br> lib to configure a package's operation.</p> 
<p>State information is generally used to preserve the condition of an application<br> (or a group of inter-related applications) between invocations and between<br> different instances of the same application. State information should generally<br> remain valid after a reboot, should not be logging output, and should not be<br> spooled data.</p> 
<p>An application (or a group of inter-related applications) must use a<br> subdirectory of /var/lib for its data. There is one required subdirectory, /var<br> /lib/misc, which is intended for state files that don't need a subdirectory;<br> the other subdirectories should only be present if the application in question<br> is included in the distribution. [38]</p> 
<p>/var/lib/&lt;name&gt; is the location that must be used for all distribution<br> packaging support. Different distributions may use different names, of course.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, are required in /<br> var/lib:</p> 
<p>Directory       Description<br> misc      Miscellaneous state data</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /var/<br> lib, if the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory                    Description<br> &lt;editor&gt;  Editor backup files and state (optional)<br> &lt;pkgtool&gt; Packaging support files (optional)<br> &lt;package&gt; State data for packages and subsystems (optional)<br> hwclock   State directory for hwclock (optional)<br> xdm       X display manager variable data (optional)</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/lib/&lt;editor&gt; : Editor backup files and state (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>These directories contain saved files generated by any unexpected termination<br> of an editor (e.g., elvis, jove, nvi).</p> 
<p>Other editors may not require a directory for crash-recovery files, but may<br> require a well-defined place to store other information while the editor is<br> running. This information should be stored in a subdirectory under /var/lib<br> (for example, GNU Emacs would place lock files in /var/lib/emacs/lock).</p> 
<p>Future editors may require additional state information beyond crash-recovery<br> files and lock files - this information should also be placed under /var/lib/<br> &lt;editor&gt;.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: Previous Linux releases, as well as all commercial vendors, use<br>     /var/preserve for vi or its clones. However, each editor uses its own<br>     format for these crash-recovery files, so a separate directory is needed<br>     for each editor.</p> 
<p>    Editor-specific lock files are usually quite different from the device or<br>     resource lock files that are stored in /var/lock and, hence, are stored<br>     under /var/lib.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/lib/hwclock : State directory for hwclock (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory contains the file /var/lib/hwclock/adjtime.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: In FHS 2.1, this file was /etc/adjtime, but as hwclock updates<br>     it, that was obviously incorrect.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/lib/misc : Miscellaneous variable data</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory contains variable data not placed in a subdirectory in /var/lib.<br> An attempt should be made to use relatively unique names in this directory to<br> avoid namespace conflicts. [39]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/lock : Lock files</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>Lock files should be stored within the /var/lock directory structure.</p> 
<p>Lock files for devices and other resources shared by multiple applications,<br> such as the serial device lock files that were originally found in either /usr/<br> spool/locks or /usr/spool/uucp, must now be stored in /var/lock. The naming<br> convention which must be used is "LCK.." followed by the base name of the<br> device. For example, to lock /dev/ttyS0 the file "LCK..ttyS0" would be created.<br> [40]</p> 
<p>The format used for the contents of such lock files must be the HDB UUCP lock<br> file format. The HDB format is to store the process identifier (PID) as a ten<br> byte ASCII decimal number, with a trailing newline. For example, if process<br> 1230 holds a lock file, it would contain the eleven characters: space, space,<br> space, space, space, space, one, two, three, zero, and newline.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/log : Log files and directories</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory contains miscellaneous log files. Most logs must be written to<br> this directory or an appropriate subdirectory.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following files, or symbolic links to files, must be in /var/log, if the<br> corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>  File              Description<br> lastlog  record of last login of each user<br> messages system messages from syslogd<br> wtmp     record of all logins and logouts</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/mail : User mailbox files (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The mail spool must be accessible through /var/mail and the mail spool files<br> must take the form &lt;username&gt;. [41]</p> 
<p>User mailbox files in this location must be stored in the standard UNIX mailbox<br> format.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: The logical location for this directory was changed from /var/<br>     spool/mail in order to bring FHS in-line with nearly every UNIX<br>     implementation. This change is important for inter-operability since a<br>     single /var/mail is often shared between multiple hosts and multiple UNIX<br>     implementations (despite NFS locking issues).</p> 
<p>    It is important to note that there is no requirement to physically move the<br>     mail spool to this location. However, programs and header files must be<br>     changed to use /var/mail.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/opt : Variable data for /opt</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>Variable data of the packages in /opt must be installed in /var/opt/&lt;subdir&gt;,<br> where &lt;subdir&gt; is the name of the subtree in /opt where the static data from an<br> add-on software package is stored, except where superseded by another file in /<br> etc. No structure is imposed on the internal arrangement of /var/opt/&lt;subdir&gt;.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: Refer to the rationale for /opt.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/run : Run-time variable data</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory contains system information data describing the system since it<br> was booted. Files under this directory must be cleared (removed or truncated as<br> appropriate) at the beginning of the boot process. Programs may have a<br> subdirectory of /var/run; this is encouraged for programs that use more than<br> one run-time file. [42] Process identifier (PID) files, which were originally<br> placed in /etc, must be placed in /var/run. The naming convention for PID files<br> is &lt;program-name&gt;.pid. For example, the crond PID file is named /var/run/<br> crond.pid.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Requirements</p> 
<p>The internal format of PID files remains unchanged. The file must consist of<br> the process identifier in ASCII-encoded decimal, followed by a newline<br> character. For example, if crond was process number 25, /var/run/crond.pid<br> would contain three characters: two, five, and newline.</p> 
<p>Programs that read PID files should be somewhat flexible in what they accept;<br> i.e., they should ignore extra whitespace, leading zeroes, absence of the<br> trailing newline, or additional lines in the PID file. Programs that create PID<br> files should use the simple specification located in the above paragraph.</p> 
<p>The utmp file, which stores information about who is currently using the<br> system, is located in this directory.</p> 
<p>System programs that maintain transient UNIX-domain sockets must place them in<br> this directory.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/spool : Application spool data</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>/var/spool contains data which is awaiting some kind of later processing. Data<br> in /var/spool represents work to be done in the future (by a program, user, or<br> administrator); often data is deleted after it has been processed. [43]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>The following directories, or symbolic links to directories, must be in /var/<br> spool, if the corresponding subsystem is installed:</p> 
<p>Directory             Description<br> lpd       Printer spool directory (optional)<br> mqueue    Outgoing mail queue (optional)<br> news      News spool directory (optional)<br> rwho      Rwhod files (optional)<br> uucp      Spool directory for UUCP (optional)</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/spool/lpd : Line-printer daemon print queues (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The lock file for lpd, lpd.lock, must be placed in /var/spool/lpd. It is<br> suggested that the lock file for each printer be placed in the spool directory<br> for that specific printer and named lock.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Specific Options</p> 
<p>Directory               Description<br> printer   Spools for a specific printer (optional)</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/spool/rwho : Rwhod files (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>This directory holds the rwhod information for other systems on the local net.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: Some BSD releases use /var/rwho for this data; given its<br>     historical location in /var/spool on other systems and its approximate fit<br>     to the definition of `spooled' data, this location was deemed more<br>     appropriate.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/tmp : Temporary files preserved between system reboots</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>The /var/tmp directory is made available for programs that require temporary<br> files or directories that are preserved between system reboots. Therefore, data<br> stored in /var/tmp is more persistent than data in /tmp.</p> 
<p>Files and directories located in /var/tmp must not be deleted when the system<br> is booted. Although data stored in /var/tmp is typically deleted in a<br> site-specific manner, it is recommended that deletions occur at a less frequent<br> interval than /tmp.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/yp : Network Information Service (NIS) database files (optional)</p> 
<p>Purpose</p> 
<p>Variable data for the Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as the<br> Sun Yellow Pages (YP), must be placed in this directory.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: /var/yp is the standard directory for NIS (YP) data and is<br>     almost exclusively used in NIS documentation and systems. [44]</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Chapter 6. Operating System Specific Annex</p> 
<p>This section is for additional requirements and recommendations that only apply<br> to a specific operating system. The material in this section should never<br> conflict with the base standard.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Linux</p> 
<p>This is the annex for the Linux operating system.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/ : Root directory</p> 
<p>On Linux systems, if the kernel is located in /, we recommend using the names<br> vmlinux or vmlinuz, which have been used in recent Linux kernel source<br> packages.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/bin : Essential user command binaries (for use by all users)</p> 
<p>Linux systems which require them place these additional files into /bin:</p> 
<p>  * setserial</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/dev : Devices and special files</p> 
<p>The following devices must exist under /dev.</p> 
<p>/dev/null</p> 
<p>    All data written to this device is discarded. A read from this device will<br>     return an EOF condition.</p> 
<p>/dev/zero</p> 
<p>    This device is a source of zeroed out data. All data written to this device<br>     is discarded. A read from this device will return as many bytes containing<br>     the value zero as was requested.</p> 
<p>/dev/tty</p> 
<p>    This device is a synonym for the controlling terminal of a process. Once<br>     this device is opened, all reads and writes will behave as if the actual<br>     controlling terminal device had been opened.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: Previous versions of the FHS had stricter requirements for /dev.<br>     Other devices may also exist in /dev. Device names may exist as symbolic<br>     links to other device nodes located in /dev or subdirectories of /dev.<br>     There is no requirement concerning major/minor number values.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/etc : Host-specific system configuration</p> 
<p>Linux systems which require them place these additional files into /etc.</p> 
<p>  * lilo.conf</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/lib64 and /lib32 : 64/32-bit libraries (architecture dependent)</p> 
<p> The 64-bit architectures PPC64, s390x, sparc64 and AMD64 must place 64-bit<br> libraries in /lib64, and 32-bit (or 31-bit on s390) libraries in /lib.</p> 
<p>The 64-bit architecture IA64 must place 64-bit libraries in /lib.</p> 
<p><br>     Rationale: This is a refinement of the general rules for /lib&lt;qual&gt; and /<br>     usr/lib&lt;qual&gt;. The architectures PPC64, s390x, sparc64 and AMD64 support<br>     support both 32-bit (for s390 more precise 31-bit) and 64-bit programs.<br>     Using lib for 32-bit binaries allows existing binaries from the 32-bit<br>     systems to work without any changes: such binaries are expected to be<br>     numerous. IA-64 uses a different scheme, reflecting the deprecation of<br>     32-bit binaries (and hence libraries) on that architecture.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/proc : Kernel and process information virtual filesystem</p> 
<p>The proc filesystem is the de-facto standard Linux method for handling process<br> and system information, rather than /dev/kmem and other similar methods. We<br> strongly encourage this for the storage and retrieval of process information as<br> well as other kernel and memory information.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/sbin : Essential system binaries</p> 
<p>Linux systems place these additional files into /sbin.</p> 
<p>  * Second extended filesystem commands (optional):</p> 
<p>      + badblocks</p> 
<p>      + dumpe2fs</p> 
<p>      + e2fsck</p> 
<p>      + mke2fs</p> 
<p>      + mklost+found</p> 
<p>      + tune2fs</p> 
<p>  * Boot-loader map installer (optional):</p> 
<p>      + lilo</p> 
<p>Optional files for /sbin:</p> 
<p>  * Static binaries:</p> 
<p>      + ldconfig</p> 
<p>      + sln</p> 
<p>      + ssync</p> 
<p>    Static ln (sln) and static sync (ssync) are useful when things go wrong.<br>     The primary use of sln (to repair incorrect symlinks in /lib after a poorly<br>     orchestrated upgrade) is no longer a major concern now that the ldconfig<br>     program (usually located in /usr/sbin) exists and can act as a guiding hand<br>     in upgrading the dynamic libraries. Static sync is useful in some emergency<br>     situations. Note that these need not be statically linked versions of the<br>     standard ln and sync, but may be.</p> 
<p>    The ldconfig binary is optional for /sbin since a site may choose to run<br>     ldconfig at boot time, rather than only when upgrading the shared<br>     libraries. (It's not clear whether or not it is advantageous to run<br>     ldconfig on each boot.) Even so, some people like ldconfig around for the<br>     following (all too common) situation:</p> 
<p>     1. I've just removed /lib/&lt;file&gt;.</p> 
<p>     2. I can't find out the name of the library because ls is dynamically<br>         linked, I'm using a shell that doesn't have ls built-in, and I don't<br>         know about using "echo *" as a replacement.</p> 
<p>     3. I have a static sln, but I don't know what to call the link.</p> 
<p>  * Miscellaneous:</p> 
<p>      + ctrlaltdel</p> 
<p>      + kbdrate</p> 
<p>    So as to cope with the fact that some keyboards come up with such a high<br>     repeat rate as to be unusable, kbdrate may be installed in /sbin on some<br>     systems.</p> 
<p>    Since the default action in the kernel for the Ctrl-Alt-Del key combination<br>     is an instant hard reboot, it is generally advisable to disable the<br>     behavior before mounting the root filesystem in read-write mode. Some init<br>     suites are able to disable Ctrl-Alt-Del, but others may require the<br>     ctrlaltdel program, which may be installed in /sbin on those systems.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/include : Header files included by C programs</p> 
<p>These symbolic links are required if a C or C++ compiler is installed and only<br> for systems not based on glibc.</p> 
<p>    /usr/include/asm -&gt; /usr/src/linux/include/asm-&lt;arch&gt;<br>     /usr/include/linux -&gt; /usr/src/linux/include/linux</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/usr/src : Source code</p> 
<p>For systems based on glibc, there are no specific guidelines for this<br> directory. For systems based on Linux libc revisions prior to glibc, the<br> following guidelines and rationale apply:</p> 
<p>The only source code that should be placed in a specific location is the Linux<br> kernel source code. It is located in /usr/src/linux.</p> 
<p>If a C or C++ compiler is installed, but the complete Linux kernel source code<br> is not installed, then the include files from the kernel source code must be<br> located in these directories:</p> 
<p>    /usr/src/linux/include/asm-&lt;arch&gt;<br>     /usr/src/linux/include/linux</p> 
<p>&lt;arch&gt; is the name of the system architecture.</p> 
<p>    Note: /usr/src/linux may be a symbolic link to a kernel source code tree.</p> 
<p>    Rationale: It is important that the kernel include files be located in /usr<br>     /src/linux and not in /usr/include so there are no problems when system<br>     administrators upgrade their kernel version for the first time.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>/var/spool/cron : cron and at jobs</p> 
<p>This directory contains the variable data for the cron and at programs.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Chapter 7. Appendix</p> 
<p>The FHS mailing list</p> 
<p>The FHS mailing list is located at<br> &lt;freestandards-fhs-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net&gt;. You can subscribe to the<br> mailing list at this page http://sourceforge.net/projects/freestandards/.</p> 
<p>Thanks to Network Operations at the University of California at San Diego who<br> allowed us to use their excellent mailing list server.</p> 
<p>As noted in the introduction, please do not send mail to the mailing list<br> without first contacting the FHS editor or a listed contributor.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Background of the FHS</p> 
<p>The process of developing a standard filesystem hierarchy began in August 1993<br> with an effort to restructure the file and directory structure of Linux. The<br> FSSTND, a filesystem hierarchy standard specific to the Linux operating system,<br> was released on February 14, 1994. Subsequent revisions were released on<br> October 9, 1994 and March 28, 1995.</p> 
<p>In early 1995, the goal of developing a more comprehensive version of FSSTND to<br> address not only Linux, but other UNIX-like systems was adopted with the help<br> of members of the BSD development community. As a result, a concerted effort<br> was made to focus on issues that were general to UNIX-like systems. In<br> recognition of this widening of scope, the name of the standard was changed to<br> Filesystem Hierarchy Standard or FHS for short.</p> 
<p>Volunteers who have contributed extensively to this standard are listed at the<br> end of this document. This standard represents a consensus view of those and<br> other contributors.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>General Guidelines</p> 
<p>Here are some of the guidelines that have been used in the development of this<br> standard:</p> 
<p>  * Solve technical problems while limiting transitional difficulties.</p> 
<p>  * Make the specification reasonably stable.</p> 
<p>  * Gain the approval of distributors, developers, and other decision-makers in<br>     relevant development groups and encourage their participation.</p> 
<p>  * Provide a standard that is attractive to the implementors of different<br>     UNIX-like systems.</p> 
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> 
<p>Scope</p> 
<p>This document specifies a standard filesystem hierarchy for FHS filesystems by<br> specifying the location of files and directories, and the contents of some<br> system files.</p> 
<p>This standard has been designed to be used by system integrators, package<br> developers, and system administrators in the construction and maintenance of<br> FHS compliant filesystems. It is primarily intended to be a reference and is<br> not a tutorial on how to manage a conforming filesystem hierarchy.</p> 
<p>The FHS grew out of earlier work on FSSTND, a filesystem organization standard<br> for the Linux operating system. It builds on FSSTND to address interoperability<br> issues not just in the Linux community but in a wider arena including<br> 4.4BSD-based operating systems. It incorporates lessons learned in the BSD<br> world and elsewhere about multi-architecture support and the demands of<br> heterogeneous networking.</p> 
<p>Although this standard is more comprehensive than previous attempts at<br> filesystem hierarchy standardization, periodic updates may become necessary as<br> requirements change in relation to emerging technology. It is also possible<br> that better solutions to the problems addressed here will be discovered so that<br> our solutions will no longer be the best possible solutions. Supplementary<br> drafts may be released in addition to periodic updates to this document.<br> However, a specific goal is backwards compatibility from one release of this<br> document to the next.</p> 
<p>Comments related to this standard are welcome. Any comments or suggestions for<br> changes may be directed to the FHS editor (Daniel Quinlan<br> &lt;quinlan@pathname.com&gt;) or the FHS mailing list. Typographical or grammatical<br> comments should be directed to the FHS editor.</p> 
<p>Before sending mail to the mailing list it is requested that you first contact<br> the FHS editor in order to avoid excessive re-discussion of old topics.</p> 
<p>Questions about how to interpret items in this document may occasionally arise.<br> If you have need for a clarification, please contact the FHS editor. Since this<br> standard represents a consensus of many participants, it is important to make<br> certain that any interpretation also represents their collective opinion. For<br> this reason it may not be possible to provide an immediate response unless the<br> inquiry has been the subject of previous discussion.</p>

<p>Notes</p> 
<p>[1]  Command binaries that are not essential enough to place into /bin must be<br>      placed in /usr/bin, instead. Items that are required only by non-root<br>      users (the X Window System, chsh, etc.) are generally not essential enough<br>      to be placed into the root partition.</p> 
<p>[2]  Programs necessary to arrange for the boot loader to be able to boot a<br>      file must be placed in /sbin. Configuration files for boot loaders must be<br>      placed in /etc.</p> 
<p>     The GRUB bootloader reads its configurations file before booting, so that<br>      must be placed in /boot. However, it is a configuration file, so should be<br>      in /etc. The answer here is a symbolic link such as /etc/grub/menu.lst -&gt;<br>      /boot/menu.lst.</p> 
<p>[3]  On some i386 machines, it may be necessary for /boot to be located on a<br>      separate partition located completely below cylinder 1024 of the boot<br>      device due to hardware constraints.</p> 
<p>     Certain MIPS systems require a /boot partition that is a mounted MS-DOS<br>      filesystem or whatever other filesystem type is accessible for the<br>      firmware. This may result in restrictions with respect to usable filenames<br>      within /boot (only for affected systems).</p> 
<p>[4]  The setup of command scripts invoked at boot time may resemble System V,<br>      BSD or other models. Further specification in this area may be added to a<br>      future version of this standard.</p> 
<p>[5]  It is recommended that files be stored in subdirectories of /etc rather<br>      than directly in /etc.</p> 
<p>[6]  Systems that use the shadow password suite will have additional<br>      configuration files in /etc (/etc/shadow and others) and programs in /usr/<br>      sbin (useradd, usermod, and others).</p> 
<p>[7]  On some Linux systems, this may be a symbolic link to /proc/mounts, in<br>      which case this exception is not required.</p> 
<p>[8]  /etc/X11/xdm holds the configuration files for xdm. These are most of the<br>      files previously found in /usr/lib/X11/xdm. Some local variable data for<br>      xdm is stored in /var/lib/xdm.</p> 
<p>[9]  Different people prefer to place user accounts in a variety of places.<br>      This section describes only a suggested placement for user home<br>      directories; nevertheless we recommend that all FHS-compliant<br>      distributions use this as the default location for home directories.</p> 
<p>     On small systems, each user's directory is typically one of the many<br>      subdirectories of /home such as /home/smith, /home/torvalds, /home/<br>      operator, etc. On large systems (especially when the /home directories are<br>      shared amongst many hosts using NFS) it is useful to subdivide user home<br>      directories. Subdivision may be accomplished by using subdirectories such<br>      as /home/staff, /home/guests, /home/students, etc.</p> 
<p>[10] If you want to find out a user's home directory, you should use the<br>      getpwent(3) library function rather than relying on /etc/passwd because<br>      user information may be stored remotely using systems such as NIS.</p> 
<p>[11] It is recommended that apart from autosave and lock files programs should<br>      refrain from creating non dot files or directories in a home directory<br>      without user intervention.</p> 
<p>[12] Shared libraries that are only necessary for binaries in /usr (such as any<br>      X Window binaries) must not be in /lib. Only the shared libraries required<br>      to run binaries in /bin and /sbin may be here. In particular, the library<br>      libm.so.* may also be placed in /usr/lib if it is not required by anything<br>      in /bin or /sbin.</p> 
<p>[13] The usual placement of this binary is /usr/bin/cpp.</p> 
<p>[14] This is commonly used for 64-bit or 32-bit support on systems which<br>      support multiple binary formats, but require libraries of the same name.<br>      In this case, /lib32 and /lib64 might be the library directories, and /lib<br>      a symlink to one of them.</p> 
<p>[15] /lib&lt;qual&gt;/cpp is still permitted: this allows the case where /lib and /<br>      lib&lt;qual&gt; are the same (one is a symbolic link to the other).</p> 
<p>[16] A compliant implementation with two CDROM drives might have /media/cdrom0<br>      and /media/cdrom1 with /media/cdrom a symlink to either of these.</p> 
<p>[17] If the home directory of the root account is not stored on the root<br>      partition it will be necessary to make certain it will default to / if it<br>      can not be located.</p> 
<p>     We recommend against using the root account for tasks that can be<br>      performed as an unprivileged user, and that it be used solely for system<br>      administration. For this reason, we recommend that subdirectories for mail<br>      and other applications not appear in the root account's home directory,<br>      and that mail for administration roles such as root, postmaster, and<br>      webmaster be forwarded to an appropriate user.</p> 
<p>[18] Originally, /sbin binaries were kept in /etc.</p> 
<p>[19] Deciding what things go into "sbin" directories is simple: if a normal<br>      (not a system administrator) user will ever run it directly, then it must<br>      be placed in one of the "bin" directories. Ordinary users should not have<br>      to place any of the sbin directories in their path.</p> 
<p>     For example, files such as chfn which users only occasionally use must<br>      still be placed in /usr/bin. ping, although it is absolutely necessary for<br>      root (network recovery and diagnosis) is often used by users and must live<br>      in /bin for that reason.</p> 
<p>     We recommend that users have read and execute permission for everything in<br>      /sbin except, perhaps, certain setuid and setgid programs. The division<br>      between /bin and /sbin was not created for security reasons or to prevent<br>      users from seeing the operating system, but to provide a good partition<br>      between binaries that everyone uses and ones that are primarily used for<br>      administration tasks. There is no inherent security advantage in making /<br>      sbin off-limits for users.</p> 
<p>[20] This is particularly important as these areas will often contain both<br>      files initially installed by the distributor, and those added by the<br>      administrator.</p> 
<p>[21] Examples of such configuration files include Xconfig, XF86Config, or<br>      system.twmrc)</p> 
<p>[22] Miscellaneous architecture-independent application-specific static files<br>      and subdirectories must be placed in /usr/share.</p> 
<p>[23] For example, the perl5 subdirectory for Perl 5 modules and libraries.</p> 
<p>[24] Some executable commands such as makewhatis and sendmail have also been<br>      traditionally placed in /usr/lib. makewhatis is an internal binary and<br>      must be placed in a binary directory; users access only catman. Newer<br>      sendmail binaries are now placed by default in /usr/sbin. Additionally,<br>      systems using a sendmail-compatible mail transfer agent must provide /usr/<br>      sbin/sendmail as a symbolic link to the appropriate executable.</p> 
<p>[25] Host-specific data for the X Window System must not be stored in /usr/lib/<br>      X11. Host-specific configuration files such as Xconfig or XF86Config must<br>      be stored in /etc/X11. This includes configuration data such as<br>      system.twmrc even if it is only made a symbolic link to a more global<br>      configuration file (probably in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11).</p> 
<p>[26] The case where /usr/lib and /usr/lib&lt;qual&gt; are the same (one is a symbolic<br>      link to the other) these files and the per-application subdirectories will<br>      exist.</p> 
<p>[27] Software placed in / or /usr may be overwritten by system upgrades (though<br>      we recommend that distributions do not overwrite data in /etc under these<br>      circumstances). For this reason, local software must not be placed outside<br>      of /usr/local without good reason.</p> 
<p>[28] /usr/local/man may be deprecated in future FHS releases, so if all else is<br>      equal, making that one a symlink seems sensible.</p> 
<p>[29] Locally installed system administration programs should be placed in /usr/<br>      local/sbin.</p> 
<p>[30] Much of this data originally lived in /usr (man, doc) or /usr/lib (dict,<br>      terminfo, zoneinfo).</p> 
<p>[31] Obviously, there are no manual pages in / because they are not required at<br>      boot time nor are they required in emergencies. Really.</p> 
<p>[32] For example, if /usr/local/man has no manual pages in section 4 (Devices),<br>      then /usr/local/man/man4 may be omitted.</p> 
<p>[33] A major exception to this rule is the United Kingdom, which is `GB' in the<br>      ISO 3166, but `UK' for most email addresses.</p> 
<p>[34] Some such files include: airport, birthtoken, eqnchar, getopt,<br>      gprof.callg, gprof.flat, inter.phone, ipfw.samp.filters,<br>      ipfw.samp.scripts, keycap.pcvt, mail.help, mail.tildehelp, man.template,<br>      map3270, mdoc.template, more.help, na.phone, nslookup.help, operator,<br>      scsi_modes, sendmail.hf, style, units.lib, vgrindefs, vgrindefs.db,<br>      zipcodes</p> 
<p>[35] Generally, source should not be built within this hierarchy.</p> 
<p>[36] This standard does not currently incorporate the TeX Directory Structure<br>      (a document that describes the layout TeX files and directories), but it<br>      may be useful reading. It is located at ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex/</p> 
<p>[37] For example, /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1 is formatted into /var/cache/man/<br>      cat1/ls.1, and /usr/X11R6/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man3/XtClass.3x into /var/cache/man<br>      /X11R6/&lt;locale&gt;/cat3/XtClass.3x.</p> 
<p>[38] An important difference between this version of this standard and previous<br>      ones is that applications are now required to use a subdirectory of /var/<br>      lib.</p> 
<p>[39] This hierarchy should contain files stored in /var/db in current BSD<br>      releases. These include locate.database and mountdtab, and the kernel<br>      symbol database(s).</p> 
<p>[40] Then, anything wishing to use /dev/ttyS0 can read the lock file and act<br>      accordingly (all locks in /var/lock should be world-readable).</p> 
<p>[41] Note that /var/mail may be a symbolic link to another directory.</p> 
<p>[42] /var/run should be unwritable for unprivileged users (root or users<br>      running daemons); it is a major security problem if any user can write in<br>      this directory.</p> 
<p>[43] UUCP lock files must be placed in /var/lock. See the above section on /var<br>      /lock.</p> 
<p>[44] NIS should not be confused with Sun NIS+, which uses a different<br>      directory, /var/nis.</p>
