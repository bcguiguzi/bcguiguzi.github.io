一是：自我介绍，如自己来自什么地方，毕业学校，所学专业，业余喜好，家庭基本情况等信息。
二是：做好用英语讲解自己专业 的准备。
口语测试时老师有可能要求你就本专业展开话题，考查你用英语讲解陌生概念的能力。因此考生对此要有所准备，先用笔头组织这些问题的要点，然后再以 这些词组织语言。在阅读专业文献时，也要多积累一些专业方面的英语词汇。当然提问的问题不可能难度太高。
1、考试形式：内容包括自我介绍和提问回答，一般是一到两名老师参与口语考试，首先是考生自我介绍，其次是老师对同学的即兴提问。
2、提问一般包含如下两部分：
第一部分：考查学生理解并回答有关日常生活、家庭、工作、学习等问题的能力（3–5分钟）。
第二部分：考查学生连续表达的能力。考生从所给的问题中选择一个话题，就此话题表达自己的看法（7–10分钟）。
3、评价成绩一般为：
（1）优秀——能用外语就指定的话题进行口头交流，基本没有困难。
（2）良好——能用外语就指定的题材进行口头交流，虽有些困难，但不影响交流。
（3）及格——能用外语就指定的话题进行简单的口头交流。
（4）不及格——不具有口头表达能力。

<h3><a id="_59"></a>三、考研英语复试口语连续表达问题列举</h3> 
<ol><li>What are the characteristics of a good teacher? Use reasons and examples to support your response.<br> 解析：</li></ol> 
<h4><a id="_63"></a>一、考生在回答自由发挥题目时要明确题干中要求自己讨论的是什么，利用主题句加上支持细节的方法进行准备如下。</h4> 
<p>Topic statement: A good teacher is supposed to possess a number of characteristics. Supporting details: What are the characteristics? 1. knowledgeable: source of information 2. easy-going: get well with his students in class or after class 3. a real friend to the students</p> 
<h4><a id="_66"></a>二、经过上面的分析，考生可以在三个方面进行自己的个人陈述。</h4> 
<p>这个部分中，考生应该注意自己的语音语调，语速不要过快，不要让人感觉你在背诵别人 的文章。考生要注意自己平时训练的风格，可以在陈述中丰满上面备考中的内容， 运用例子、原因越充分越好。 参考答案：<br> I think a good teacher should have many characteristics. First of all, he must be a person with knowledge. You know, a teacher should be source of information to his students. Many parents would like their kids to learn more at school. Next, a teacher should be easy-going, humorous in or after class so that his students would like to stay with him. I am sure if students like their teacher very much, they will begin to enjoy the course taught by the teacher. Finally, I hope a good teacher can become a real friend to his students. I mean, a good teacher can be trusted by his students. Well, sometime, students would come across problems in real life, they don’t want to ask their parents for help. Instead, they would find some advice from their friends. If their friends are also teenagers, students would ask some adult friends for advice. I think a good teacher can play such a role. Those are the characteristics a good teacher should possess.</p> 
<h4><a id="_72"></a>三、点评</h4> 
<p>在上述的参考答案中，考生利用主题句加上支持细节的方法来阐述自己的观点。请注意上述参考答案中的划线部分。这些内容可以使得考生在备考中规范自己的语言和逻辑，从而使得发言完整、连贯。考生不必语速过快。当然考生可以 适当在发言时有感而发，保证内容被比较翔实地表达出来。<br> Some universities require first-year students to live in dormitories on campus. Others allow students to live off campus. Which policy do you think is better for first-year students and why? Include details and examples in your explanation.</p> 
<p>解析：<br> 一、考生在回答自由发挥题目时要明确题干中要求自己讨论的是什么，针对该部分特点，做出清晰的判断，制定出自己发言的主题。从而利用主题句加上支 持细节的方法进行准备如下。<br> Topic statement: Universities should require first-year students to live in dormitories on campus. Reasons and Supporting details:<br> 1.Safety: Teachers can be responsible for students’ daily life.<br> 2.Convenience: All the school facilities are available to students.<br> 3.Building of students’ various abilities: Students can learn how to communicate and cooperate with others.<br> 4.Disadvantages of living off campus: Students are faced with many practical problems such as living expenses, safety.</p> 
<p>二、经过上面的分析，考生可以在四个方面进行自己的个人陈述。这个部分中，考生应该注意自己的语音语调，语速不要过快，不要让人感觉你在背诵别人 的文章。考生要注意自己平时训练的风格，可以在陈述中丰满上面备考中的内容， 运用例子、原因越充分越好。尤其是可以运用自身或身边家人、朋友的例子，因 为考官对这些例子更加感兴趣。<br> 参考答案：<br> Well, from the topic I can see a student leaves his high school and steps into a university where all is new to him. He would soon become familiar with everything. I think he should enjoy living on campus first. Some universities have required first-year students to live in dormitories on campus, which is exactly a good policy.First of all, living on campus is safe because teachers will take care of the first-year students. For example, dormitories are examined by teachers daily so thatthe living environment can be kept safe. I still remember my tutor on campus examined our dormitory every night and forced us to go sleeping before 22:00.Well, Strangers were not allowed to enter our dormitory. Next, there are many facilities on campus such as the library, and the swimming-pool. Students can relax themselves after school by reading in the library and swimming. As for me, I really enjoyed swimming and I was lucky because there was a large swimming-pool on campus. Besides, I suppose living on campus can become an effective way for students to learn how to communicate with others. I mean, several students can share one dormitory. They would have many opportunities to exchange their ideas and thoughts so that they can understand communication and cooperation are very important. Gradually, they can be good at communication and cooperation with others. Instead, living off campus could not offer such advantages to first-year students. Students have no ability to manage the practical problems such as safety. And rental for a place to live in is higher than that for living on campus.Last, I think it is also unlikely for teachers to be responsible for the life and development of students who live off campus.<br> 三、点评<br> 在上述的参考答案中，考生利用主题句加上支持细节的方法来阐述自己的观点。另外。针对上述题目的特点，考生可以适当地加入对大一新生住在校外这个问题的讨论。但是讨论的内容一定是要以突出大一新生应该住在校内为目的。这 样可以使得考官认为考生对题目的看法是全面的，综合的。请注意上述参考答案中的划线部分。这些内容可以使得考生在备考中规范自己的语言和逻辑，从而使得发言完整、连贯。</p>

This must be a philosophy of a good teacher… She/he should be patient and kind, flexible<br> and resourceful, tolerant and open minded with a good sense of humor. Enthusiastic and enjoys teaching.<br> should be honest, imaginative and creative. Efficient. Self-disciplined. Helpful. Humble and modest.<br> Leader<br> Have a vision. Effective leaders and their organizations have an agenda. A vision. A vision is a direction—an<br> attractive and attainable picture of the future. As a leader, if you don’t know where you are going, you are<br> irrelevant to you followers. With a vision you can inspire and lift individuals and groups to new heights—<br> an important function of any leader. The visionary process is made up of fundamentally three steps:<br> discovering the vision, disseminating the vision and finally, driving the vision forward.<br> Seize opportunity. Look for experiences that are new and different. Develop relationships with people who<br> are different from the people you ordinarily have relationships with, especially those that come from<br> different backgrounds and age groups. See movies and plays, read books and visit museums. These will<br> broaden your outlook and develop a deeper well from which to draw from. We must learn to observe<br> closely and accurately. Above all, we must stay comfortable with “not knowing … but finding out.”<br> Learn to delegate. Only do what can’t be done by someone else.<br> Reward results!<br> Communication is key. Be accessible to everyone in the organization. Companies need to realize that the old<br> model of the leaders sitting on top of the pyramid and the managers executing orders does not work in<br> today’s environment. The person at the top cannot be the only leader. There have to be various people<br> within the company acting in this role. There are many companies stuck in a rut where the managers are<br> waiting to be told what to do. That doesn’t work.<br> Be proactive. Promote continuous exploration of yourself and other leaders within the organization. Be<br> accountable for what you do. If there is an issue in the company, don’t say you didn’t know anything about it.<br> Look at the organization and constantly ask what can be improved.<br> A business leader has to keep her organization focused on the mission. That sounds easy, but it can be<br> tremendously challenging in today’s competitive and ever-changing business environment. A leader also<br> has to motivate potential partners to join the cause.<br> ——Meg Whitman (MBA 79)<br> President and CEO, eBay<br> Event<br> 休闲娱乐题<br> 室内: 看书,听音乐<br> 户外: 运动,公园<br> 传统风俗题<br> 美德: 谦虚<br> 节日: 春节<br> 职业与抱负<br> 我的回忆录<br> 休闲娱乐题<br> 读书<br> 书名及作者,定语从句,被动语态<br> 最吸引你的内容,时间顺序/因果顺序<br> 得到的启示<br> 总结升华<br> 老人与海 The Old Man and the Sea<br> When I have time, I read books. My favorite book is the Old Man and the Sea which is written by Ernest<br> Hemingway, one of the greatest American writers.<br> The book told us a story about an old man called Diego who did fishing in Cuba. Though he came across lots<br> of difficulties on the sea and came back without a single fish, he was optimistic and still held the hope.<br> Diego is like a mirror which reflects what Hemingway wanted to tell all of us: Never give up and the final<br> success will come right after the last try. I’ve stuck on that wisdom all the time ever since I read this book for that<br> story makes me believe there is no stronger thing ever than a strong human belief.<br> 听音乐<br> 音乐名<br> 介绍听音乐的好处 (1,2,3)<br> 总结,升华<br> Hero, Mariah Carey<br> Relaxing and comforting<br> Ease my pressure on study<br> Learn how to sing an English song<br> Inspiring, gives me so much strength that I need when I am facing up with any difficulty in my entire life.<br> Music is a worldwide language without any translation, by listening to the music, we can share our emotions<br> with different people around the world.<br> What else can we say about music?<br> „<br> Style:<br> „<br> Classic: Mozart, Chopin<br> „<br> Pop music: Rap/Hip hop/Heavy metal<br> „<br> Operas and musicals: Cats, the Phantom of the Opera, Notre Dame de Paris<br> 美德<br> 美德是什么?<br> 好处 123<br> 总结深化谈影响<br> 谦虚是美德<br> 做个好听众<br> 看长处补短处<br> 我谦虚所以我进步<br> Modest and humble<br> A good listener with tolerance, only well-educated people can show tolerant to others and understand<br> different opinions<br> Always see the best sides of and learn something from others<br> With modest and humble, we can make progress everyday.<br> Virtues<br> Honesty<br> Sincerity<br> Easy going and down to earth<br> Environmental protector<br> Animal protection advocate<br> 节日题: 春节<br> 春节(笔记)<br> 春节时间与形式<br> 大家团圆包饺子,包完饺子放鞭炮,全家祝福好来年<br> 团圆是根本,祝福是风俗<br> 时间描述动作连贯<br> 意义阐释体现亲情<br> Spring Festival, Chinese Lunar New Year, compared with Christmas in western countries<br> Family get together, make dumplings, sit around the table, toast to each other, make a wish for the coming<br> year, wish everybody good luck.<br> Means a lot/ the whole world to Chinese people<br> Other Festivals<br> Instructions<br> Mid-autumn Day<br> Family reunion<br> Moon-cakes, like a moon, representing the family reunion in Chinese traditional means<br> 地点<br> 名胜古迹<br> 特点:强调历史意义与文化<br> 适用题目:<br> In the city you live, which part is your favorite?<br> Which park or public area do you usually go?<br> Introduce your favorite area in your city.<br> What place you never visited before you want to visit most?<br> Places like:</li><li>Summer Palace</li><li>Forbidden City<br> Sample answer<br> Summer Palace.<br> It is one of the finest sights in the city.

Its construction began in 1406 and was completed 14 years later, having a history so<br> far of some 580 years. Twenty-four emperors from the Ming and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties lived and ruled<br> China from there.

What type of films do your friends like? / What kind of films does the<br> people who as old as you like?</li><li>Do you often go to the cinema/theatre? Which cinema do you often go to?. 4. Who’s your favorite film star? Can you describe him/her to me?</li><li>What qualities do you think are important for a successful or good film?<br> There are many good films such as “Gone with the Wind”, “Sound of Music”. I think these films are<br> successful because the noble ideas and tender sentiments are really able to touch the heart of the audience. So for a<br> good film, the plot, the skill of the director, the performance of actors and actress are all important factors. In<br> addition to the talent of a director and a movie star, a film’s social message is of great importance, too. Such as<br> marriage, divorce, children and money, they are always true to life. Besides, I think the script plays a big part of a<br> film. Without a good script, even if the director, the leading actor and actress are first-rate, the film can’t possibly<br> be first-rate. If a story is too shallow, the film stars won’t have any chance to show their talent. Also, people such<br> as supporting actors and actresses, cameramen and composers are important, too.<br> 六、Success<br> Describe the most unforgettable/recent success in your life.<br> You should say: What it is? When and where did you do it? How did you get it? Why it is important for<br> you?<br> I would like to tell you something about my excellent diploma project. In March this year, I started to prepare<br> for my diploma project. The grade of the diploma project was very important for me to apply for the University of<br> Sydney, so I must try my best to do it well. At that time my buddy and I were practicing in the Great Wall<br> Securities Company of Shenzhen, so our tutor suggested us to develop a System of Internet Stocks Analysis.<br> However, our major was Computer Science and we didn’t know a little about securities, so it was a great attempt<br> and challenge to us. At first I had no confidence, but my parents and my tutor all encouraged me. As is a common<br> saying that ”Could you see the rainbow without experiencing the rainstorm?”, I understood that it was necessary<br> to experience a certain difficulty on the way to success. So I made up my mind to grasp the nettle. Then I went to<br> the Book Shopping Center, went to the library, and surfed the Internet to collect information. It took me a month<br> to read a great number of books and some famous softwares, taking the essence and discarding the dregs. The<br> process of developing software was filled with not only difficulty but also delight. We had no experience in<br> developing software, so we had to do everything gropingly. During this time, our tutor gave much good advice to<br> us. With her great help and our great effort, we overcame the main difficulty at last. We were very excited and felt<br> on top of the world. Through hard working for two months, we completed the System of Internet Stocks Analysis<br> in the end. The competitive examination was another difficulty. Four learned professors continually put complex<br> questions to me. At the beginning, I was quite nervous. But I had profound understanding on my diploma project,<br> so soon I was composed myself and answered every question carefully. Finally the professors were satisfied with<br> smile. Fortunately my diploma project got a grade of excellent. The process of getting success was very<br> unforgettable. And I knew that the hard working and the strong will are the most important things to success.<br> (Pig: I would like to tell you something about my excellent thesis. In March this year, I started to prepare for<br> my thesis. The grade of the thesis was very important for me to apply for the University of Sydney, so I must try<br> my best to do it well. My topic was about the cost of the law, that means to analyze the law through economic<br> method. It was a great attempt and challenge to me, because my major was Law and I didn’t know much about<br> Economics. However, as is a common saying that ”Could you see the rainbow without experiencing the<br> rainstorm?”, I understood that it was necessary to experience a certain difficulty on the way to success. So I made<br> up my mind to grasp the nettle. Then I went to the Book Shopping Center, went to the library, and surfed the<br> Internet to collect information. It took me a month to read a great number of books and some famous dissertations,<br> taking the essence and discarding the dregs. When I had a clear idea, I started writing. During this time, my tutor<br> and my mother gave much good advice to me. With their great help, I completed the thesis at last. The competitive<br> examination was another difficulty. Three learned professors continually put complex questions to me. At the<br> beginning, I was quite nervous. But I had profound understanding on my thesis, so soon I was composed myself<br> and answered every question carefully. Finally the professors were satisfied with smile. Fortunately my thesis got<br> a grade of excellent. The process of getting success was very unforgettable. And I knew that the hard working and<br> the strong will are the most important things to success.)<br> 七、Education / School<br> 1.What kind of teaching material do you think is a good one? Is it necessary to improve the teaching<br> material?</li><li>What do you think of the popularity of English in China?<br> I think it’s the inevitable. I mean the world is getting closer and closer, so it’s inevitable that the world begins<br> to use a common language. That means you can get a larger range of knowledge if you understand English. If you<br> want to do well in business you should at least know a little English. Some of the best industries in the future will<br> be involved in the international trade so if you are good at English you will have more and better opportunities.<br> Therefore the popularity of English in China is really for practical reasons.</li><li>How can education be reformed to meet the future challenges?<br> I think that we should pay more attention to the higher education. That means the government should put a<br> great deal of money on the improvement of the facilities in the university, and allocate more funds on the<br> academic research. We should attract better professors to enhance the quality of education. Moreover, I think there<br> should be more opportunities for long-distance learning programs from various universities around the world so<br> that many Chinese can get the benefit of overseas education without traveling so far to other countries.<br> 八、Childhood<br> 1.What was your favorite story in your childhood?<br> It is an interesting question. Let me see. In my childhood, the story “the wolf is coming ” impressed me. It’s<br> about a little shepherd who always told a lie that the wolf was coming so at last his sheep were all bitten by the<br> wolf. This story will affect me all my life. It reminds me that we should be honest and reliable.<br> 3.What is the most memorable thing in your childhood?<br> I remember that when I was young, one day I went out by myself and got lost. When I was helpless, an old man<br> gave me a favor and sent me home. It impressed me deeply. And I often tell to myself that I should try my best to<br> help others.<br> 九、Festival<br> 1.What do you do during the spring festival?<br> I usually spend the time with my parents. We eat delicious food, visit family and friends, and watch TV to<br> welcome the New Year. I also like to try and contact my school friends and see how they’re doing and what they’re<br> up to. We give presents each other and we buy ourselves new clothes to wear for the New Year.<br> 十、Music</li><li>What role do you think music play in our life?<br> Just as other kinds of art, music has become an indispensable part of human civilization. It brings us with<br> nutritious spiritual food and enriches our leisure life. In addition, music can elicit the imagination of us. And it<br> teaches us how to distinguish beauty from the nature. Listening to the music, I am sure you will soon be refreshed<br> from a day’s hard work.<br> E a clean and safe work place.<br> 十一、TV programs<br> 1.How does the TV set change in China? Compared to ten years ago, and how will it develop?<br> Ten years ago, Chinese TV set’s manufacture mostly depended on foreign technique, so if the people had<br> enough money they would like to buy imported TV, because Chinese TV was really not so good in quality.<br> However, now Chinese TV set is not only low in price and good in quality, deeply loved by Chinese people, but<br> also is exported to many foreign countries and gain high evaluation. From this we can see that today the<br> manufacturing technique of Chinese TV set has made great progresses and even formed its own characteristic,<br> such as digital TV set. And I think in the future ten years, web TV will be developed gradually. Internet will be<br> brought in to the TV, or endow TV the function of Internet, and people can even use TV to get on line.<br> 十二、Friend</li><li>what kind of person you dislike?<br> I dislike the person who has the following shortcomings. He often deceives others and speaks of other’s evils<br> or boasts of his own merits. In addition, he makes more friends with those who can offer help. The friendship<br> often breaks up if the friends are of no use to him. I am sick of this kind of person.<br> 还有一些例题：(选自 iBIT 新托福考试口语试题)<br> 1Does TV have the positive or negative effect on the modern society?
